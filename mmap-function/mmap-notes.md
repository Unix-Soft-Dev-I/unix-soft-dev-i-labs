## Research About `mmap` Function

The mmap function in Unix-like operating systems is used to map files or devices into memory. This allows a process to access file contents directly through memory addresses, providing a mechanism for efficient file I/O and inter-process communication.

### Function Prototype
```c
void *mmap(void *addr, size_t length, int prot, int flags, int fd, off_t offset);
```

### Parameters

- addr: Starting address for the mapping (can be NULL to let the kernel choose).
- length: Number of bytes to map.
- prot: Desired memory protection of the mapping (e.g., PROT_READ, PROT_WRITE).
- flags: Determines the nature of the mapping (e.g., MAP_SHARED, MAP_PRIVATE).
- fd: File descriptor of the file to map.
- offset: Offset in the file where the mapping starts.

### Return Value

- On success, mmap returns a pointer to the mapped area.
- On failure, it returns MAP_FAILED and sets errno.

### Some Applications

- File I/O: Efficient reading/writing large files by mapping them into memory.
- Shared Memory: Shared memory regions for inter-process communication.
- Memory Management: Dynamically map and unmap memory regions as needed.
